#GPS-Converter-2

Fork from https://github.com/bdhurkett/Laser-GPS-Converter-2 to adapt to my GPS Navbike 400 (and many other GPS Watch/Counter).

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thom-x/Laser-GPS-Converter-2/master/demo.png "Demo")

New features :
- Heart rate
- Elevation
- Export all button
- "Material design"

*An improved version of the first converter, because I'm too lazy to refactor and redesign it.*
